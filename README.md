# RentApp

- Developed an Android application that automatically generates a contract PDF when a host, who owns an Airbnb or apartment, receives guest information and signatures.
- Guest Information Collection: The app allows hosts to input guest details (name, address, contact information, etc.).
Signature Capture: The app provides a digital signature feature for both the host and the guest to sign the contract.
- Contract Generation: Once the information is collected, the app automatically generates a contract PDF, including all necessary details such as guest and host information, rental terms, and signatures.
- Storage & Sharing: The generated PDF can be saved locally or sent via email to the host and guest.
